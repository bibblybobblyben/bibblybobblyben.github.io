This page contains links to any work of mine which has managed to slip through the review process and become publihed, in reverse chronological order.  I've included a brief description giving an overview of the topic covered in each work.

------------------
This paper builds on the below mass mapping approach on the curved sky to try and improve the quality of the map produced. There are effects other than just the curvature of the surface to consider when producing weak lensing mass maps. A significant issue is that to go from a map of shape distortions to a map of the mass distribution, it is usually necessary to go from the coordinate space to either Fourier space or spherical harmonics. If your map of the distortions is incomplete across the whole field, performing this transformation introduces noise into your map. This is true for all surveys - surveying the whole sky completely is incredibly difficult, so usually only a portion of the sky is observed. It is therefore necessary to find a way to remove these errors - this paper proposes one such technique. Instead of transforming the shape data through to the mass map, we instead fit to the data. Through hypothesising mass maps in spherical harmonics and fitting these to the observed data through exploring the likelihood space of potential maps, we demonstrate that we can produce maps with signfiicantly reduced errors, as the data is never transformed.

## <span style="color:LightSkyBlue"> Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Curved-Sky Weak Lensing Mass Map </span>

-------------------
Gravity affects the propagation of late, causing both the apparent position and shape of objects to change. As gravity is caused by matter, detecting gravity means we are detecting mass. Measuring the shape of objects compared to their expected shape therefore gives a technique for detecting the distribution of matter, and this paper does so using small distortions in the shape of galaxies. As this map is so large, spanning over 1000 deg ^2 on the sky, it becomes necessary to account for the curvature of the sky to produce the map, which is done through working in spherical harmonics. This paper explores this technique, demonstrating it to work well and quantifies the performance. It uses a large cosmological data set consisting of measurements of millions of galaxies.
