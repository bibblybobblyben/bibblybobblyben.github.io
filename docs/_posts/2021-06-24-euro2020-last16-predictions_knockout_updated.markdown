Following the conclusion of the group stages of the Euro 2020 tournament, the rankings for each team have been recalculated and winning probabilities updated. To find out how each team is expected to do, read on.


## Updated team power ratings
The predictive model relies on building attacking and defensive rankings for each team - in both cases, a higher score means the team is better at that skill. The figure below shows every competitor ranked in attacking and defensive qualities. Teams that lie in the bottom left are poor at attacking and defending, whereas teams in the top right are good at both of these. Teams top left are good attackers and poor defenders, whereas teams bottom right would be good defenders but poor attackers.

Most teams are in the low rankings for both attacking and defending; Ukraine, Wales, Austria and Sweden all qualified for the last 16 but are quite similar in ability to many of the teams that have already been eliminated.  

Many of the teams, and the familiar suspects for winning the tournament, have high attack ratings but there is a large range in their defensive abilities. **Italy** have by far and away the best defensive rating, but their attack is not rated much differently to that of Portugal or Switzerland.  
**Belgium** have the best attacking rank, but their defence is considered to be of a similar ability to England and Denmark. The possible line up of Belgium vs Italy in the quarter finals could offer an interesting line up of the best attack versus the best defence - the model expects Italy's defence to have the edge in this encounter.    

**France**, the popular favourite for the tournament, have long been unfavoured by the model and the fact it is not ranked exceptional for attacking or defensive performance explains this. **England** are the best ranked side in their side of the draw, being above avergae for both defence and attack. 



## Full tournament forecast

By simulating each match many times, we can forecast the whole tournament. Plotted below is every slot in the knockout stage, with the team most likely to appear at that position and their probability.

Most interestingly, the performance of Italy in the group stages seems to have nudged them into our model's favourites, now expected to overcome Belgium and go on to win the tournament. England's appearance in a half of the draw that consists of teams with much lower rankings than them means they are considered the most likely team to reach the semi finals, given a 50% chance of arriving there.
