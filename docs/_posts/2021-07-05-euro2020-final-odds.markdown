Only 4 team are left, and the results are getting increasingly difficult to predict! We have had some surprise results along the way, but each team left in the competition by now is a contender for the title. All four were highly rated by the model before the competition, with four of the models top 5 sides making this semis. The exception, the pre-tournament favourites of Belgium, were elimanated by the models new favourites Italy. Italy are still the favourites to win each game they play, but the margins are very close. 





<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:32px;background-color:mediumslateblue;padding:20px;">Italy vs Spain</h1>

 |2.14|**Italy**|4.13|**Spain**|3.45| 


The first semi final sees Italy play Spain. Spain are a highly rated attacking side, and Italy's defensive strength seems to be enduring, although they have conceded recently. Italy are almost evens to win this game, whereas Spain have a less than 1 in 3 chance of winning; these weights favour Italy slightly more than bookmakers are currently suggesting, with Italy currently priced at 2.50 and Spain at 3.0. 

Spain are a strong attacking side, and the model does expect them to have quite a good chance of scoring, which is an achievement against this Italian defence! However, Spain have also been conceding, and Italy are expected to score more than Italy, perhaps suggesting a 2 or 3 - 1 scoreline.

<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:32px;background-color:mediumslateblue;padding:20px;">England vs Denmark</h1>

The other side of the draw sees two sides built on solid defences. England are yet to concede and Denmark are also highly ranked in this regard, and the model expects a pretty tight game! The last time we saw odds similar to these was in the France vs Switzerland game. These odds are quite different to bookmakers, with Denmark priced above 5.0 for the game, suggesting they believe they have a much lower chance of winning. England have however played Denmark a few times over the past few years and have struggled against them. 

One reason for this disagreement between our model and the bookmakers is illuminated if we consider the form based model, with odds below. If we apply more weight to recent games, England become strong favourites, with Denmark slipping to under a 30% chance of winning and England approaching a 50% chance. This importance on recent games is likely driving the bookmaker's odds, alongside betting behaviour on the favourites. England have been slowly drifting to longer odds, originally priced at around 1.6 and now above 1.7, whereas Denmark were at 5.75-6 and now down to around 5.2.

The goal distributions are also quite tight, with 1-1 again appearing most likely. Denmark are slightly less likely to score, and this becomes a much starker difference when we used the form based model to incorporate England's recent run of clean sheets. England's defensive form is giving them the edge, with Denmark expected to score a goal less based off this form.

<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:64px;background-color:darkred;padding:32px;">Final</h1>


The model expects an Italy vs England final, but as there are relatively few permutations possible at the minute I'll go through the probabilities for every game possible here. Each game is listed below with all different forms of the model outputs. 

Italy are expected to beat all opponents, and alongside England are coming into the game with the best form. The form based model improves both of these sides chances. In the Italy vs England game, the form model makes a draw much more likely, as England become less likely to concede to Italy. However, this is counteracted by Italy's defensive form meaning England are also much less likely to score. 

If Denmark qualify, Italy's form makes the model significantly more confident in an Italy win and make them odds on to win the match.

If Spain win, their form is similar to Denmark's and both models reach similar probabilities. However if England go through, England's form is slightly better and their chances of winning improve based off of form, although they are not expected to score as many goals as previously. England scored freely in qualifying but have been much more defensively minded in this tournament.
