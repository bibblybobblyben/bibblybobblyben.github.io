Hi,  


Welcome to my website! I'm Ben Mawdsley - a Data Scientist with a Ph.D. in Cosmology. I have an interest in statistical inference and using machine learning for new applications. Head over to the Papers tab for an oversight of my published work, or go to Data Dabbles to read some other work I've done in a less formal setting. All of the work on this page is presented in a personal capacity. 
  

#Experience
I mainly work in `python`.


### Employment
## Data Scientist - UKRI 2019 - Present

I work with clients in academia and industry to develop new applications of machine learning approaches to solve their problems, working with those with little technical expertise through to dedicated software teams. I have worked on NLP tasks, for problems such as sentiment analysis and topic clustering, as well as using deep learning for image segmentation. I have also worked with graph databases, predominantly `neo4j`, for exploring interconnected datasets, and used Bayesian approaches for modelling and classifying data. None of my work on this website is related to my present employment. 

## Ph.D. 
University of Portsmouth 2015-2019  
I studied Cosmology at the University of Portsmouth, specifically the effect of weak lensing. This refers to the effect where gravity slightly changes the apparent shape of distant galaxies, and observing this effect is a powerful probe of the structure of the Universe. I developed a forward fitting pipeline to produce maps of the dark matter in the Universe, using data from the Dark Energy Survey, and papers detailing this work can be found on the Papers tab. My work utilise Bayesian methods for inference and sampling techniques such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, producing software which was capable of modelling images on the sphere. I also developed experience with supercomputing through the SCIAMA facility at Portsmouth.
